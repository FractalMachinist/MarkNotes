# MarkNotes Client
The MarkNotes client serves the client-side web page for MarkNotes.

MarkNotes' client is acting as a prototype, balancing the desire to reuse existing tools such as (CodeMirror)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/codemirror] with a desire to display text in sections defined by MarkDown headings. For personal or incidental use, this interface is functional but far from perfect.
